      description: ClusterGateway is an extension model for ManagedCluster which implements
        the Tier-II cluster model based on OCM's original abstraction of ManagedCluster.
        The Tier-II cluster model should be highly protected under RBAC policies and
        only the admin shall have the access to view the content of cluster credentials.
